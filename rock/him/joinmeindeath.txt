Join Me In Death
Him

Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death

We are so young
Our lives have just begun
But already we're considering
Escape from this world

And we've waited for so long
For this moment to come
We're so anxious to be together
Together in death

Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
Would you die?
Baby join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death

This world is a cruel place
And we're here only to lose
So before live tears us apart let
Death bless me with you

Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
Would you die?
Baby join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death

This life ain't worth living
This life ain't worth living
(Join me, join me, join me)
This life ain't worth living
(Join me, join me, join me)
This life ain't worth living

Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
Would you die?
Baby join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death

Baby join me in death
