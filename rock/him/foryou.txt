For You
Him

In the grace of your love
I writhe, writhe in pain
In 666 ways I love you
And I hope you feel the same

I'm for you
I'm for you

I'm killing myself
For your love
And again all is lost
In 777 ways I love you
Till my death do us apart

I'm for you
And I'm dying for your love
I'm for you
And my heaven is wherever you are
I'm for you
And I'm dying for your love
I'm for you
And my heaven is wherever you are

In 666 ways, I love you
And my heaven is wherever you are

I'm here for you
I am here for you
I'm here for you
I am here for you
I'm here for you
I am here for you
I'm here for you
I am here for you
