Poison Girl
Him

I did it all just for her
I did it all just for her
And love's heart is death
For me and my poison girl

A prey she was for the cruelty of love
While its serpent inside crawled straight towards her heart
The coldest kiss, love ceased tô exist
While we grew apart like never before

I did it all just for her, I did it all just for her
Love wants us dead, just me and my poison girl
I did it all just for her, I did it all just for her
Love's heart is death, for me and my poison girl

The fire in her eyes grew dim and then died
As the poison inside reached her heart
And the coldest bliss faith ceased tô exist
As we grew apart like never before

I did it all just for her, I did it all just for her
Love wants us dead, just me and my poison girl
I did it all just for her, I did it all just for her
Love's heart is death, for me and my poison girl

And the taste of the poison on her lips
Is of a tomb

I did it all just for her, I did it all just for her
Love wants us dead, just me and my poison girl
I did it all just for her, I did it all just for her
Love's heart is death, for me and my poison girl

In this poison world
