Give me love laced with lies
There ain't much I haven't tried
Give me love laced with lies
There ain't much, baby, I haven't tried

There's so much, so much, so much I need
There's so much, so much, so much that I need

Turn your back, because you've shown your pain
There's nothing you really need to explain, no

There's so much, so much, so much that I need
There's so much, so much, so much I need, need, need
Hit it

You're killing me and I'm killing you
You can't keep me from what I gotta do
No, no, no

There's so much, so much, so much I need
There's so much, so much, so much that I need
There's so much, so much, so much I need
There's so much, so much, so much that I need
